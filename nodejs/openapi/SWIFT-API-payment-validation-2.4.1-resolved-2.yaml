  title: Payment Pre-validation
  description: "Enable your application to validate your cross-border payment instructions as early as possible in the payment process.\n\n**v2.4.1 Release Notes**\n\nAs part of the continuous development of Payment Pre-validation API services, a new validation service is available as below. In addition, there are some minor changes to the descriptions and examples for the other existing services to align with the functional specification document.\n\n  **Payment Instruction validation service** - This service provides a contextual payment validation. It is meant for a debtor bank or payment initiating end-customer who wants to validate a combination of payment elements, and that with one single API:\n  * Debtor Agent Country\n  * Creditor Agent Country\n  * Creditor Account\n  * Instructed Currency, and\n  * Instructed Amount\n  \n  Based on the elements provided, the service orchestrates multiple validations (note that these validations remain as well available as individual services). This contextual validation service is designed as such, that new validations of additional elements can easily be integrated in the future. \n  \n  Further to this new validation service, updates have been made to the error response examples with the updated internal error codes."

      summary: Verify that a beneficiary account could be able to receive incoming funds.
      description: |
        The service verifies that an account exists and is capable of receiving incoming funds. The service uses the beneficiary bank subscribed as data provider to perform the account verification that usually implies that the account is open, properly identified by the given number and, depending on the jurisdiction and market practices in use where the account is held, that the creditor name matches the name of the account holder. When the beneficiary bank did not subscribe as data provider, SWIFT will use pseudonymized account statistics to perform the account number verification that implies that the account exists and is likely to receive funds and the creditor name will not be verified. SWIFT and the beneficiary banks subscribed as data provider do not take liability for the response and do not provide any guarantee on the outcome of an actual transaction being sent to this account. The information provided is meant to be as accurate as possible at the time that the request was processed. The requester must pass the creditor name and the service provider can use this information as part of the verification or not.

The x-bic value must correspond to the BIC of the beneficiary bank subscribed to the service as Data Provider and performing the beneficiary account validation when the clients want to validate beneficiary account information exclusively with the beneficiary bank. The x- BIC value must be SWIFT BIC (swhqbebb) to use the beneficiary bank when it is subscribed to the service as data provider or to use the pseudonymized account statistics when the beneficiary bank is not subscribed to the service as data provider.

            *AINP_account_data_collection_in_progress* - SWIFT account format data coverage index indicates that the account data collection process is in progress (below 90% level of completion).

            *CCTY_consistent_country* - The instructed country code matches the country of the payment information that is subject to validation.

            *CFIN_consistent_financial_institution_identification* - The instructed financial institution matches the financial institution that uses the account format of the instructed account.

            *INCT_inconsistent_country* - The instructed country code does not match the country of the payment information that is subject to validation.

            *IFIN_inconsistent_financial_institution_identification* - The instructed financial institution identifier does not match the  financial institution that owns the account that is the subject to the account format validation.

            *IBBN_invalid_bban* - The instructed account identifier subject to account format validation does not have a valid Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) format for the instructed payment context.

            *IBIC_invalid_bic* - The instructed financial institution identifier subject to financial institution identity validation is not a  valid BIC for the instructed payment context.

            *ICTY_invalid_country* - Instructed country code is not a valid country code on the basis of country names obtained from the United Nations (ISO 3166, Alpha-2 code).

            *IDOM_invalid_domestic_bank_specific* - The instructed account identifier subject to account format validation does not have a valid domestic, bank specific format (nor national domestic standard nor bank specific standard) for the instructed payment context.

            *IIBN_invalid_iban* - The instructed account identifier subject to account format validation does not have a valid IBAN format for the instructed payment context.

            *ICCH_check_not_applied* - The individual payment validation check has not been applied for the instructed context. Other individual payment validation checks are more relevant and will be applied instead.

            *MCTY_missing_country_code* - Country code is missing from the payment context in order for the validation of the instructed payment information to be performed.

            *MFIN_missing_financial_institution_identifier* - Financial Institution Identifier is missing from the payment context in order for the validation of the instructed payment information to be performed.

            Below reasons are for *Beneficiary_Account_Verification* check, wherein the beneficiary bank is the data provider (BAV) and has provided the response:

            BAV:

            *creditor_account_match = MTCH/NMTC* - the creditor account match response code.

        This example returns an overall 'WARNING' result due to some of the underlying individual element validations returning a warning and others returning a valid or not available result. None of the individual element validations resulted in an actual error.

        In this example, the beneficiary bank is not a Data Provider. Consequently, the Creditor Account (it's existence) is being validated centrally by SWIFT using the pseudonymized account statistics. And also, the format of the provided creditor account is separately validated.

        For Singapore, a reason for payment (purpose description) is recommended. If it is missing then the Payment Purpose validation will result in a warning.

        This example returns an overall 'ERROR' result due to at least one of the underlying individual element validations resulting in an error. Here, the payment purpose validation failed. For India, both a payment purpose code and a payment purpose description are required. Both elements are missing in the provided context.

        The creditor agent IDIBINBB is a data provider. So, the validation tried to have the creditor account validated directly by that creditor agent, via the beneficiary account validation service. Unfortunately, this service returned a technical error (note: service error count is 1 in Validation Summary).

        Note also that no central validation was applied on the account/account format.
