      Payment Transactions - Getting a Payment Transaction

      Purpose of the API
      * This API is a payment query to get detailed information regarding a given payment. It requires the UETR to be known.
      
      Examples of use cases are
      * Debtor status check - ordering BIC or ordering customer wants to see the status 
      * Creditor status check - beneficiary BIC or beneficiary customer wants to see the status

      Payment Transactions - Getting the Last Changed Payment
      Transactions 
      
      Purpose of the API
      * This API is a delta query to get all payment update information starting from a given date and time. This API allows synchronization of a local database with the Tracker database. There is a paging mechanism in case the response becomes too large. This is done through returning a "next" token in the response, so that the delta query can continue from the last returned result.

        The access token obtained as a result of OAuth 2.0 flows. SWIFT supports two OAuth grant types depending on the API service.
        * JWT-Bearer grant type [RFC 7523](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523)
        * Password grant type
        
        This API uses JWT-Bearer grant type.
        
        Please visit [SWIFT OAuth Token API](https://developer.swift.com/swift-oauth-token-api) page for more information and examples on how to generate an OAuth token.
          
        In this declaration only the basic security element to transport the bearer token of an OAuth2 process is declared.
